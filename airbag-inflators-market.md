<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Airbag Inflators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pyrotechnic Inflators</li><li>Stored Gas Inflators</li><li>Hybrid Inflators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The airbag inflators market consists of three main types: pyrotechnic inflators, stored gas inflators, and hybrid inflators. Pyrotechnic inflators use a small amount of explosive material to rapidly heat stored gas and inflate the airbag. Stored gas inflators store compressed gas and release it to inflate the airbag when a collision occurs. Hybrid inflators combine the features of both pyrotechnic and stored gas inflators, utilizing a small pyrotechnic charge to rupture a stored gas chamber and inflate the airbag.</p></p>

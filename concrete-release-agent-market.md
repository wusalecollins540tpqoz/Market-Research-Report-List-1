<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Concrete Release Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oil Based</li><li>Water Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Concrete release agents are used to create a barrier between freshly poured concrete and the forming material to prevent adhesion. There are two main types of concrete release agents based on their formulation: oil-based and water-based. Oil-based release agents contain petroleum-based oils and solvents while water-based release agents contain water as the main carrier. Oil-based release agents are preferred for their longer shelf life and ability to produce a glossy finish, while water-based release agents are more environmentally friendly and easier to clean up. Both types have their own advantages and are used based on specific preferences and requirements.</p></p>

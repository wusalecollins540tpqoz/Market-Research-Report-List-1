<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Choke Inductor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-Inductor</li><li>Mutual Inductor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Choke inductors can be classified into two main types - self-inductors and mutual inductors. Self-inductors consist of a single coil of wire that creates a magnetic field when current flows through it, resulting in inductance. Mutual inductors, on the other hand, have two or more coils that are magnetically coupled, causing a change in current in one coil to induce a change in current in the other coil. Both types of choke inductors are essential components in electronic circuits for filtering, noise suppression, and energy storage purposes.</p></p>

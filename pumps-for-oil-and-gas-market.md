<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pumps for Oil and Gas Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Pumps</li><li>Positive Displacement Pumps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pumps for oil and gas market can be divided into two main types: centrifugal pumps and positive displacement pumps. Centrifugal pumps operate by using centrifugal force to increase the pressure and flow of the fluid. They are commonly used in applications where high flow rates are required. Positive displacement pumps, on the other hand, work by trapping a fixed amount of fluid then forcing it into the discharge pipe. They are often used in applications where accurate dosing or high pressure is needed.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Floating LNG Terminal Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Floating LNG Import Terminals</li><li>Floating LNG Export Terminals</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Floating LNG Import Terminals are offshore facilities that receive liquefied natural gas from tankers and then convert it back into gas for storage and distribution. These terminals are used to provide energy to regions without onshore infrastructure. On the other hand, Floating LNG Export Terminals are facilities that liquefy natural gas from onshore sources and store it on floating vessels for export via tanker ships. These terminals are essential for countries looking to capitalize on their natural gas reserves through international trade.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fluid Chillers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water Cooled</li><li>Air Cooled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fluid chillers are cooling systems used in various industries to regulate the temperature of liquids or gases. There are two main types of fluid chillers: water-cooled and air-cooled. Water-cooled chillers use water as a coolant, which is circulated through a heat exchanger to remove heat from the system. Air-cooled chillers, on the other hand, use air to dissipate heat from the system. Both types have their own advantages and are chosen based on factors like efficiency, cost, and available space.</p></p>

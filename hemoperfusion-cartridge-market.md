<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hemoperfusion Cartridge Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Charcoal Hemoperfusion</li><li>Certain Resins Hemoperfusion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hemoperfusion cartridges are devices used in medical treatments to remove toxins from the bloodstream. There are two main types of hemoperfusion cartridges: charcoal hemoperfusion and certain resins hemoperfusion. Charcoal hemoperfusion utilizes activated charcoal to filter out toxins, while certain resins hemoperfusion uses specific resins to adsorb toxins. Both types of hemoperfusion cartridges work by passing the patient's blood through the cartridge, where toxins are trapped and removed before the cleaned blood is returned to the body. These cartridges are commonly used in the treatment of poisoning and overdose cases.</p></p>

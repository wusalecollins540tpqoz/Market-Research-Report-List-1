<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The TEE Ultrasound Probes Disinfectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intermediate/Low-Level Disinfection (LLDs/ILDs)</li><li>High-Level Disinfection (HLD)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Intermediate/Low-Level Disinfection (LLDs/ILDs) refers to the process of disinfecting TEE ultrasound probes at a lower level of intensity, typically using chemical disinfectants. This method is effective in eliminating most pathogens, but may not completely eradicate certain types of microorganisms. On the other hand, High-Level Disinfection (HLD) involves more stringent procedures and is capable of killing a broader range of microorganisms, including bacterial spores. HLD is necessary for ensuring the highest level of patient safety when using TEE ultrasound probes.</p></p>

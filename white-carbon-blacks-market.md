<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The White Carbon Blacks Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fumed White Carbon Black</li><li>Precipitation White Carbon Black</li></ul></p>
<p><p>White Carbon Blacks are classified into two main types - fumed white carbon black and precipitation white carbon black. Fumed white carbon black is produced by the high-temperature combustion of hydrocarbons, resulting in particles with high purity and large surface area. This type is commonly used in industrial applications such as rubber and plastic industries. On the other hand, precipitation white carbon black is produced through a chemical reaction between metal salts and sodium silicate, leading to smaller particles ideal for use in industries like paints and coatings.</p></p>

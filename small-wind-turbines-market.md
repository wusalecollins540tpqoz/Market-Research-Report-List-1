<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Small Wind Turbines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine</li><li>Vertical Axis Wind Turbine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Small wind turbines market consists of two main types: Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines (HAWT) and Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWT). HAWT have blades that rotate around a horizontal axis, while VAWT have blades that rotate around a vertical axis. HAWT are more commonly used due to their higher efficiency and power output. VAWT, on the other hand, have the advantage of being able to generate electricity from wind coming from any direction, making them suitable for urban and turbulent wind environments.</p></p>

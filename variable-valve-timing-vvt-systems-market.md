<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Variable Valve Timing (VVT) Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vane-type VVT</li><li>Gear-type VVT</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Variable Valve Timing (VVT) Systems play a crucial role in improving engine performance and fuel efficiency. There are two main types of VVT systems: Vane-type VVT and Gear-type VVT. Vane-type VVT systems use a rotor with vanes that rotate to control the timing of the valves, while Gear-type VVT systems use gears to adjust valve timing. Both systems work by varying the timing of valve opening and closing to optimize engine performance at different RPMs, resulting in improved power output and fuel efficiency.</p></p>

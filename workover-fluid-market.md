<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Workover Fluid Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Brine</li><li>Polymer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Workover fluids are used in the oil and gas industry to maintain wellbore stability and improve production. Two main types of workover fluids are brine and polymer fluids. Brine fluids are typically composed of salt water or other electrolytes, which help control formation pressure and prevent wellbore collapse. Polymer fluids, on the other hand, are formulated with synthetic polymers to provide rheological control and reduce friction during well interventions. Both types of workover fluids play a crucial role in enhancing well performance and maximizing oil and gas production.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Touch Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Resistive</li><li>Capacitive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The touch sensors market is divided into two main types: resistive and capacitive. Resistive touch sensors work by applying pressure to the surface, causing two conductive layers to come into contact and create an electrical signal. These sensors are cost-effective and can be used with a stylus or gloved hand. On the other hand, capacitive touch sensors operate by detecting changes in the electrical field when a conductive object, like a finger, approaches the surface. They offer better durability, high clarity, and multi-touch capabilities but are generally more expensive.</p></p>

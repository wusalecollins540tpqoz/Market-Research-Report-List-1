<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Optical Fibers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Multi-Mode Fiber Optics</li><li>Single-Mode Fiber Optics</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Optical fibers are classified into two main types based on the way light travels inside the fiber: Multi-Mode Fiber Optics and Single-Mode Fiber Optics. In Multi-Mode Fiber Optics, light signals travel through the fiber in multiple paths, allowing for the transmission of multiple signals simultaneously. Single-Mode Fiber Optics, on the other hand, allows light signals to travel in a single path, resulting in higher data transmission speeds over longer distances. Both types are widely used in telecommunications, data centers, and other high-speed communication applications.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Amorphous Core Transformers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oil-Immersed Amorphous Core Transformers</li><li>Dry-Type Amorphous Core Transformers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Amorphous core transformers can be categorized into two main types: oil-immersed and dry-type. Oil-immersed amorphous core transformers are filled with insulating oil to cool and insulate the transformer, making them suitable for high-power applications. On the other hand, dry-type amorphous core transformers do not require oil for cooling and insulation, making them more environmentally friendly and suitable for indoor installation. Both types offer high efficiency and reduced energy losses, making them popular choices for various industrial and commercial applications.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polymerized Rosin Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Type I</li><li>Type II</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polymerized Rosin Market Types can be classified into Type I and Type II. Type I refers to rosin that has gone through a process of polymerization, which results in a higher degree of polymerization compared to regular rosin. This type of polymerized rosin is ideal for applications where enhanced tackiness and adhesion are required. On the other hand, Type II polymerized rosin has a lower degree of polymerization and is more suited for applications where a softer and more flexible resin is needed, such as in adhesives and coatings.</p></p>

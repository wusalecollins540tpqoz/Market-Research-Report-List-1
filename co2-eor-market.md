<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CO2 EOR Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Industrial CO2</li><li>Natural CO2</li></ul></p>
<p><p>CO2 EOR (Enhanced Oil Recovery) market includes two main types: industrial CO2 and natural CO2. Industrial CO2 is sourced from various industries like power plants and refineries, then captured and sold for EOR operations. On the other hand, natural CO2 occurs naturally underground and can be utilized for EOR without the need for industrial capture. Both markets play a crucial role in advancing EOR technologies and helping to increase oil production while reducing emissions in the oil and gas industry.</p></p>
